# Weather chatbot

A chatbot created with [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/) which provides some information about current weather and a 2-day forecast.
It can also greet, respond to 'thank you', say goodbye and tell some crappy weather jokes. Built upon [this free weather API](https://weatherapi.com/).

### Usage examples:
- What is the weather like in Warsaw right now?
- What will be the temperature like in Lisbon tomorrow?
- Will it be raining in London in two days?
- Tell me a joke
